# Fencing

Fencing is the ultimate process of protecting the data in one, more, or even all instances of a PostgreSQL cluster when they appear to be malfunctioning. When an instance is fenced, the PostgreSQL server process (postmaster) is guaranteed to be shut down, while the pod is kept running. This makes sure that, until the fence is lifted, data on the pod is not modified by PostgreSQL and that the file system can be investigated for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

# How to fence instances

In EDB Postgres for Kubernetes you can fence:

- a specific instance
- a list of instances
- an entire Postgres Cluster

# Command

```

kubectl-cnpg fencing off cluster-sample cluster-sample-3

```
