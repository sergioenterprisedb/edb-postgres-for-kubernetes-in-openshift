# Hibernation

Sometimes you may want to suspend the execution of a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Cluster while retaining its data, then resume its activity at a later time. We've called this feature cluster hibernation.

Hibernation is only available via the kubectl cnp hibernate [on|off] commands.

Hibernating a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes cluster means destroying all the resources generated by the cluster, except the PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary instance.

You can resume an hibernation cluster with:

```

kubectl-cnpg hibernate off cluster-sample

```
